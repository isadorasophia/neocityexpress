=1a_Tutorial
    Alright, time for my first delivery as the new head of Neo City Express. 
    All I want is to make Gram-Gram proud. 
    If I think hard enough, I can almost feel the memory of her with me right now...
    [ShowGranny=true]
    Granny: Don't you worry Daggers, I believe in you!
    Thanks Gram-Gram! Let's go and make this delivery!
    Looks like today we're delivering a "Used Robot." And I'm getting a text message from the client right now...

=1a_Intro
    Cool, that should reassure them.
    Alright, time to hit the road.
    Granny: Pedal to the metal, Daggers!

=1b_TextClient
    I should text message the client to let them know that everything is going well. 
    Granny: Daggers, are you sure you should be texting while driving? 
    Don't worry Gram-Gram, clients respect aggressive and unrelenting communication. 
    Besides, if I'm going to become the best driver in Neo City, I've got to PUSH THE LIMITS!!
    Granny: Well Daggers, if you absolutely HAVE to text while driving, just be sure to do it really quickly. 
    You got it, Gram-Gram!

=1c_TextFromSis
    Look at that, I'm getting a text message from Sis.
    Granny: Oh! Tell her I said hi!
    You're a figment of my imagination Gram-Gram, but thanks anyway!

=1d_Outro
    We made it!
    The Used Robot we're delivering is in perfect condition, maybe even BETTER than before?? Is that possible?
    Granny: Aww, my baby boy drove so well he turned back time!
    Thanks Gram-Gram, it was nothing. Just doing my JOB.







=2a_Intro
    Gram-Gram, look! This package we're delivering has medicine in it!
    I'm a doctor!!
    Granny: Now now sweetie, you don't have time to be a doctor. You're so busy with work!
    Right, the most important thing is making Neo City Express the best delivery service in town.
    I've got 5 days left, so if I'm going to pull it off, I need just a little help calming my nerves.
    A quick hit of NeuroBoost should do the trick!
    Sorry Gram-Gram, I hope you don't disapprove of this...
    Granny: Don't worry Daggers, I used drugs all the time back when I was making deliveries. It's super safe! 
    Wow, Gram-Gram! Is that true, or am I just inventing that story in my memory of you?
    Granny: Who knows!
    Good enough for me. Let's hit the road and get this package delivered!

=2_NeuroBoost
    Wow, the NeuroBoost is making it way easier to drive!

=2b_Tinder
    Now that I'm so good at driving thanks to the NeuroBoost, I can use this time to catch up on my Tinder swipes.
    Granny: Daggers is now the time to be doing that?
    I can't help it Gram-Gram. I'm a MAN. I NEED this.
    Granny: Oh goodness!

=2c_TinderMatch
    Hey, I got a Tinder match!
    Granny: Remember Daggers, if you absolutely MUST text while driving, it's important to be emotionally vulnerable to your Tinder matches.
    No promises, Gram-Gram!


=2d_Outro
    We're here! Don't worry, Dr. Daggers will safely deliver this medicine to all in need!
    Granny: Now Daggers, remember not to do any surgeries or deliver any babies until you've been trained.
    Sorry Gram-Gram, I took an oath: If I see a baby I'm gonna deliver it.









=3a_Intro
    Wow... after all the NeuroBoost I took yesterday, my hands are pretty jittery.
    But I can't stop now, gotta save the family business! Right, Gram-Gram?
    Granny: Gimme some of that NeuroBoost, Daggers!
    Haha we've been over this Gram-Gram, you aren't real!
    Granny: Sigh... god almighty do I miss the sweet taste of designer substance...

=3b_Steady
    Damn, I'm swerving left.

=3c_MoreDrug
    It's no use, the NeuroBoost wore down all my nerves. I can't stop swerving to the left.
    Hey, I know! I'll just use a hit of k-HyperX to counteract the negative effects of the NeuroBoost!
    See, Gram-Gram? It's a harmonious balance. This is what nature wants.
    [HyperXEnabled = true]

=3d_Tinder
    Hell yeah, I'm getting another message from my Tinder match. Daggers is gonna get lucky tonight, Gram-Gram!
    Granny: Did I ever tell you that I met your grandfather on Tinder?
    You did?? I didn't know that.
    Granny: It's true! That's why I have the Tinder logo tattooed to my back.
    Haha I'm learning all sorts of amazing things about you, Gram-Gram!

=3e_Outro
    Another delivery, in the bag. Not even the limitations of the human body can stop Daggers McBlack!
    Granny: Remember dearie, you can overcome any physical limitation or illness simply by believing in yourself!
    Haha that sounds pretty inaccurate Gram-Gram! I'll just play it safe and stick to drugs.







=4a_Intro
    Phew boy... I can't believe how tired I am...
    Gotta say Gram-Gram, they don't tell you in school how sleepy you get after you take drugs!
    Granny: Daggers, you know the schools are nothing but propaganda and lies perpetuated by-
    Gram-Gram I don't have time for one of your possibly-racist tirades. I've got a package to deliver!
    Okay, I just need to shake off the tiredness and focus on the road.

=4b_Drugs
    Woahhhh there, the ol' eyes are starting to droop!
    Granny: Time for drugs!
    No Gram-Gram, you're the one who always told me: "Three days of drugs, one day of rest."
    I've gotta find another way to keep myself awake out here.
    I'll just shake my head as hard as possible, that'll keep me alert!

=4c_Tinder
    Granny: Daggers why are you on Tinder? Aren't you already seeing someone?
    We've been over this Gram-Gram: I'm a MAN. I have NEEDS!!
    Granny: Listen to me Daggers, dating multiple people at once is a tricky game to play.
    Granny: Is it rewarding? Hell yes it is. Better than any drug on the market. Better than NeuroBoost, better than Soma 29-31, better than all of them.
    Better than Soma 29-31???
    Granny: You bet your ass it is. But you have to be careful. Don't go throwing your heart around too easily, okay?
    Granny: Speak your mind and be authentic. Reveal your true self without shame, and trust in the love you receive from the universe!
    Gram-Gram I don't know what any of that means, but it's so beautiful I want to cry!
    Granny: Don't cry Daggers, you're still using Tinder while driving!
    Oh, right!!

=4c_Grungo
    I'm so attracted to Grungo!

=4d_Outro
    We made it! I managed to stay awake! 
    Dang, this was harder than keeping my eyes open during economics class.
    Granny: That's because economics class is a scam! Did you know that the schools are-
    You really need to stop talking, Gram-Gram!



=5a_Intro
    Wow! It's amazing what a day without drugs will do, I feel so refreshed and awake!
    And we're delivering a stack of ads?? Talk about responsibility! Who knows what kinds of useful and affordable products these ads contain!
    I've got two days left of my arbitrary commitment to making Neo City Express the best delivery service in the world.
    ...but it feels like I'm not making any real progress. What do you think, Gram-Gram? How am I doing?
    Granny: Oh Daggers sweetie, I'm just so proud of you no matter what!
    But wouldn't you be MORE proud of me if I made Neo City Express a huge success?
    Granny: Oh absolutely! Yeah, definitely, no question.
    I have to figure out a way to complete these deliveries even faster than before.
    Granny: Time for some NeuroBoost!
    No Gram-Gram, NeuroBoost won't do it today. I need something even stronger.
    All the kids are talking about something called Mylk, so I had my dealer Triple-J get some of it for me.
    Let's give it a shot!

=5b_Mylk
    Hell yeah, the Mylk is really doing its thing now!

=5c_Car
    Car: Heya Daggers, it's me! Your car!
    Uhhhh... 
    ...is my car actually talking to me? Or is this just the drugs?
    Car: What if it's both?
    Yeah! It's probably both!
    Car: Listen, buddy, I need your help. I'm a car, which means I've got NEEDS.
    Right. Oil, gears, grease, that kind of thing?
    Car: No!! I need validation! Daggers, I'm so insecure.
    Car: Does anybody love me? How do I know I'll be remembered after I'm gone?
    Aww buddy, I'm so sorry to hear about that. But you're one of my oldest and closest friends, so of course I'll remember you!
    Car: That's not enough. I need to be loved in the very specific way that cars find validation.
    Car: I need you to do some really cool stunt driving. That's the only way I'll feel useful.
    Car: Can you please drive alongside other cars without hitting them? Just do a bunch of "near-miss" drives, okay?
    Hmm, well I'm not really someone who likes driving recklessly, but for you I think I can make an exception.
    Car: Thanks, Daggers! I'll need you to do 10 near-misses before you reach your destination, otherwise I'll explode.
    Whoa! You'll explode??
    Car: Yeah! Don't worry, this is just the way that cars hold one another accountable, it's a totally normal arrangement amongst cars.
    Oh okay. But... I'm not a car.
    Car: Aren't you on drugs? How can you be sure you're not a car?
    Wow, yeah, I never thought of it like that! You're right!
    Okay, 10 near-misses, got it.
    [NearMissEnabled = true]


=5d_CarUpdate
    (NearMissCount >= 10)
        Car: Wow Daggers, you've already gotten those 10 near-misses!
        Hell yeah I have. That's the Mylk doing the driving, baby!
        Maybe I'll get a few extra along the way to our destination, just to really drive you crazy with validation.
        Car: Oh no no no, more than 10 and it starts to have a negative effect on my self-esteem.
        Golly, I'll NEVER understand how cars work...

    (...)
        Car: Hey Daggers, looks like you still haven't gotten those 10 near-misses yet.
        Yeah I'm working on it, don't worry.
        Car: Just remember, I'll explode if you don't do what I asked for!
        Car: Again, I know it sounds emotionally manipulative, but I have to stress that this is a cultural norm for us cars.
        Granny: Daggers sweetie, please don't be culturally insensitive to your own car.
        Alright, I'll do my best!



=5e_Outro
    (NearMissCount >= 10)
        We made it! And I got all 10 of the near-misses you asked for, car!
        I hope you feel really loved and validated now!
        Car: Oh I was lying about needing validation, sorry. It's just what cars do, we lie all the time.
        Car: I don't even know why, I'm not getting anything out of it! Just a cultural thing.
        Granny: Remember Daggers, lying is bad!
        Thanks Gram-Gram, I'll be sure to close my heart off to the car next time it talks to me.
        Okay, let's hurry inside and get these ads to their new home!

    (...)
        We're here, but I didn't get all 10 of the near-misses you asked for, car! Are you going to explode??
        Car: Oh no no no, I was lying about that, sorry. It's just what cars do, we lie all the time.
        Car: I don't even know why, I'm not getting anything out of it! Just a cultural thing.
        Granny: Remember Daggers, lying is bad!
        Thanks Gram-Gram, I'll be sure to close my heart off to the car next time it talks to me.
        Okay, let's hurry inside and get these ads to their new home!










=6a_Intro
    Whoa, Gram-Gram look at this! We're delivering top secret documents for the mayor!!
    Does this make me a spy? Am I a doctor AND a spy??
    Granny: Daggers, if you're going to be a spy, just remember to do it without lying to anybody, okay?
    Sigh... okay Gram-Gram, I promise not to lie to anybody while spying.
    But look, this is a really big job. Today is the final day of my commitment to making Neo City Express the best delivery service in town.
    If we can impress the mayor, who knows what he might do for us! He could make us huge!
    This is the biggest job of my life, so I need to be totally on top of my game. That's why I'm going to take drugs without looking at what I'm taking.
    If I don't know what I'm on, then it can't have any negative side effects!
    Granny: My baby boy's a doctor!
    Okay Gram-Gram, this is our final test. Let's deliver these secret documents safely and quickly, and show the mayor that we can be trusted!!



=6c_Drugs
    Wow, I'm swerving AND my eyes are drooping! Whatever I took just now was DEFINITELY drugs!
    Granny: Remember Daggers, hands at 10 and 2.
    Got it, Gram-Gram. Safety first!
    [HyperXEnabled = true]




=6b_Outro
    We're here at the mayor's home! Did we do it?
    Granny: Daggers, you made it! The secret documents are safe!
    Granny: Oh sweetie, you really are the best delivery driver in town. I'm so proud of you!
    Thank you Gram-Gram!
    Car: I'm proud of you too, Daggers!
    Thanks Car, but you already lied to me once, I won't fall for it again.
    Car: Hahaha dang, I couldn't trick you! Good job Daggers, you're really growing as a person!
    Granny: Daggers, why are you still sitting here? Go in there and deliver those secret documents to the mayor!
    You're right Gram-Gram, I've gotta finish the job and make our mayor happy. 
    Today's the day that we take Neo City Express to the next level!
    Granny: I love you Daggers!
    I love you too Gram-Gram!

    [TrueEndingUnlocked=true]


=GramSupport
    Granny: Daggers, there's something important you need to know:
    What is it, Gram-Gram?
    Granny: I love you!
    I love you too, Gram-Gram!
